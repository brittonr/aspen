## Patterns That Work

- Plugin system spans multiple crates: `aspen-plugin-api`, `aspen-wasm-plugin`, `aspen-wasm-guest-sdk`, plus individual plugin crates (`forge`, `hooks`, `service-registry`)
- `docs/planning/` contains architectural planning docs (e.g., `plugin-system.md`)
- Three sandbox backends: Hyperlight micro-VM (`plugins-vm`), hyperlight-wasm (`plugins-wasm`), Cloud Hypervisor full VM (`ci-vm`)
- Job execution also includes local shell and nix build modes
- `crates/aspen-jobs/src/vm_executor/` has the core worker implementations
- `crates/aspen-ci-executor-vm/` has CloudHypervisorWorker
- Feature flags control which backends are compiled in

## Patterns That Don't Work

- delegate_task workers may report success but not persist file changes — always verify with `git diff --stat` or `grep` after delegation
- For multi-file surgical edits, do them directly rather than delegating

## Domain Notes

- Aspen is a Rust project with a WASM plugin system using `hyperlight-wasm`
- Three-tier plugin architecture: native, WASM, gRPC/IPC
- Plugin priority range: 900-999 (WASM plugins)
- Follows FoundationDB "unbundled database" / stateless layers philosophy
- Plugins store state in core KV/blob primitives with strict key prefix namespacing
- Two separate trait hierarchies: `Worker` (aspen-jobs, job execution) and `RequestHandler` (aspen-rpc-core, RPC dispatch) — NOT unified
- `AspenPlugin` (guest SDK) bridges into `RequestHandler` via `WasmPluginHandler`
- `HandlerFactory` + `inventory` crate used for self-registration of RequestHandlers at link time
- `WorkerPool` routes jobs to Workers by `job_types()`
- KV namespace isolation: `PluginHostContext.allowed_kv_prefixes` + `validate_key_prefix()`/`validate_scan_prefix()` in `host.rs`
- Plugin KV prefixes: forge uses `forge:`, hooks uses `__hooks:`, service-registry uses `__service:`
- Empty `kv_prefixes` in manifest → auto-scoped to `__plugin:{name}:` via `with_kv_prefixes()`
- CLI `plugin install` supports `--kv-prefixes` flag and reads from plugin.json manifest
- Echo plugin example is at `examples/plugins/echo-plugin/`
- All plugin crates have `plugin_info_matches_manifest` tests that check code ↔ plugin.json consistency
- Pre-existing: `aspen-constants` has a broken doctest (renamed `CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS` → `IROH_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS`)
- Pre-existing: `aspen-cli` has unresolved `aspen_forge` import errors (unrelated to plugins)
