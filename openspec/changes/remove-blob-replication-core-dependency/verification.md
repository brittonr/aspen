## Review Scope Snapshot

No source diff for V3; readiness checker transcripts and negative mutation artifacts prove the policy boundary.

## Notes

I3 removes the stale `aspen-blob -> aspen-core` exception and adds root `aspen-core` to the blob candidate forbidden list so future default-graph regressions fail policy checks.
