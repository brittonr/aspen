# Nix Integration Architecture

Aspen integrates with the Nix ecosystem through the [snix](https://git.snix.dev/snix/snix)
project — a Rust reimplementation of Nix's store, evaluator, and builder. This replaces
subprocess calls to the `nix` CLI with in-process Rust code that shares Aspen's distributed
storage directly.

## Layered Feature Flags

Each layer builds on the previous one. Enable only what you need:

```
snix            Base: content-addressed store (BlobService, DirectoryService, PathInfoService)
├── snix-http   nar-bridge HTTP server (Nix binary cache protocol)
├── snix-daemon nix-daemon Unix socket protocol (nix path-info, nix copy)
├── snix-eval   In-process Nix evaluation (snix-eval, snix-glue, snix-serde)
│   └── snix-build  Native build execution (bubblewrap/OCI sandbox)
```

The `full` workspace feature enables all of them.

## Crate Map

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `aspen-snix` | Raft-backed `BlobService`, `DirectoryService`, `PathInfoService` trait impls |
| `aspen-castore` | Content-addressed store primitives shared across snix crates |
| `aspen-snix-bridge` | Standalone binary: gRPC server + nix-daemon socket backed by Aspen's store |
| `aspen-nix-cache-gateway` | Standalone binary: HTTP binary cache (nar-bridge axum router) |
| `aspen-ci-executor-nix` | Nix build worker for CI pipelines (eval, build, cache upload) |

## Data Flow

### Binary Cache (snix-http)

```
nix build --substituters http://host:8380
  → aspen-nix-cache-gateway (nar-bridge axum router)
    → PathInfoService::get()   → Raft KV lookup
    → BlobService::open_read() → iroh-blobs download
```

### nix-daemon Protocol (snix-daemon)

```
nix copy --to unix:///tmp/aspen.sock /nix/store/...
  → aspen-snix-bridge (nix-daemon listener)
    → NixDaemonIO::add_to_store_nar() → ingest NAR → BlobService + DirectoryService
    → NixDaemonIO::query_path_info()  → PathInfoService lookup
```

### CI Build Pipeline

The CI executor has three build paths, tried in priority order:

#### 1. Zero-subprocess (npins projects)

For projects with `npins/sources.json`. No `nix` binary involved at all.

```
git push → Forge gossip → CI trigger
  → NixBuildWorker::try_npins_native_build()
    1. snix-eval: import default.nix → derivationStrict → Derivation from KnownPaths
    2. LocalStoreBuildService: Derivation → BuildRequest → bubblewrap sandbox
    3. Upload outputs directly to PathInfoService + BlobService (from build result)
    4. nar-bridge serves built paths to downstream consumers
```

snix-eval resolves the `.drvPath` attribute, which triggers `derivationStrict` internally.
The `Derivation` object is extracted from snix-glue's `KnownPaths` — no `.drv` file
needs to exist on disk. The entire eval→build→upload pipeline runs in-process.

#### 2. Native build via flake-compat (flake projects, zero subprocesses)

For flake projects when `snix-build` feature is enabled. Uses embedded
[NixOS/flake-compat](https://github.com/NixOS/flake-compat) evaluated through
snix-eval — no `nix` subprocess needed for github, gitlab, tarball, path, or
sourcehut inputs.

```
git push → Forge gossip → CI trigger
  → NixBuildWorker::try_native_build()
    → try_flake_eval_native() [primary: flake-compat]
      1. evaluate_flake_via_compat(): import flake-compat { src = <dir>; }
      2. snix-eval's fetchTarball resolves inputs (HTTP download, narHash verify)
      3. derivationStrict → Derivation extracted from KnownPaths
    → materialize_store_paths(): missing inputs fetched from PathInfoService → disk
    → LocalStoreBuildService: Derivation → BuildRequest → bubblewrap sandbox
    → Upload outputs directly to PathInfoService + BlobService
    → nar-bridge serves built paths to downstream consumers
```

snix-eval's `fetchTarball` builtin handles HTTP downloads, tarball unpacking,
narHash verification, and store path computation internally. `SnixStoreIO`
triggers lazy fetches on-demand when `import` reads from a store path.

**Git inputs:** `builtins.fetchGit` is implemented via a local patch to
snix-glue (see `vendor/snix-glue/PATCHES.md`). Flakes with `type = "git"`
inputs are resolved fully in-process through both the call-flake.nix and
flake-compat evaluation paths.

Build execution uses `LocalStoreBuildService`, which copies inputs from the
local `/nix/store` into the bubblewrap sandbox via `cp -a`. This replaces
upstream snix-build's FUSE-based input mounting, which fails under systemd's
`ProtectSystem=strict`.

**Input closure materialization:** When input store paths are missing from the
local `/nix/store`, the executor resolves them in three stages:

1. **Castore materialization**: Walk PathInfoService + BlobService + DirectoryService
   Node trees, write files/directories/symlinks directly to disk.
2. **Upstream cache bootstrap**: For paths not in PathInfoService, query upstream
   binary caches (default: cache.nixos.org) via `UpstreamCacheClient`. Fetches
   narinfo + NAR, decompresses (xz/zstd/bzip2), ingests into castore, then
   retries materialization. BFS over references populates the full transitive closure.
3. **Subprocess fallback** (opt-in): If `nix-cli-fallback` feature is enabled and
   upstream cache can't resolve all paths, `nix-store --realise` is used as
   last resort.

```
missing paths → castore materialization
  → still missing? → UpstreamCacheClient::populate_closure()
    → fetch narinfo from cache.nixos.org
    → download + decompress NAR
    → ingest into BlobService + DirectoryService + PathInfoService
    → retry castore materialization
  → still missing? → nix-store --realise (nix-cli-fallback only)
```

#### 3. Subprocess fallback (opt-in via `nix-cli-fallback` feature)

When `snix-build` is unavailable or native builds fail. All nix CLI subprocess
calls (`nix eval`, `nix build`, `nix path-info`, `nix-store -qR`, `nix-store --realise`,
`nix flake lock`, and `curl` for tarballs) are gated behind the `nix-cli-fallback`
feature flag. Without it, the native pipeline is the only build path.

```
git push → Forge gossip → CI trigger
  → NixBuildWorker::execute_build() (subprocess fallback)
    1. nix build <flake_ref> --no-link --print-out-paths
    2. Parse output paths from stdout
    3. Upload to PathInfoService via NAR archive (read from disk)
    4. nar-bridge serves built paths
```

Gated by the `nix-cli-fallback` feature on `aspen-ci-executor-nix`.

### snix-serde Config Parsing (snix-eval)

CI pipeline definitions can be written in Nix (`.aspen/ci.nix`) and deserialized
directly into Rust structs via `snix_serde::from_str`. Pure evaluation is enforced —
no I/O builtins are available during config parsing.

## Storage Architecture

All snix services share the same underlying Raft-replicated storage:

- **BlobService** → iroh-blobs (content-addressed by BLAKE3 hash)
- **DirectoryService** → Raft KV (directory tree nodes keyed by digest)
- **PathInfoService** → Raft KV (store path metadata: NAR hash, size, references, signatures)

## Authorization Contract

SNIX DirectoryService and PathInfoService RPCs are authorized with SNIX-specific
capabilities rather than generic KV scopes. Directory and path-info reads map to
`Operation::SnixRead` resources (`dir:<digest>` and `pathinfo:<digest>`), while
writes map to `Operation::SnixWrite` resource-class prefixes (`dir:` and
`pathinfo:`). Generic `Read`, `Write`, or `Full` capabilities over `snix:` keys do
not authorize SNIX store mutation; operators should delegate `SnixRead` /
`SnixWrite` capabilities scoped to the resource class they intend to expose.
Root/bootstrap tokens intentionally include empty-prefix `SnixRead` and
`SnixWrite` capabilities so cluster operators retain full store authority.

The gRPC bridge (`aspen-snix-bridge`) exposes these services to external `snix-store`
and `nix` CLI tools. The HTTP gateway (`aspen-nix-cache-gateway`) serves them via the
standard Nix binary cache protocol.
