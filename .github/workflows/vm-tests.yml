# VM-based Integration Tests for Aspen Cluster
#
# NOTE: This workflow is currently disabled because the flake does not provide
# the required outputs (nixosConfigurations, cluster-test check).
#
# The NixOS VM test infrastructure has been removed from the flake.
# Integration testing is now done via:
# - The main CI workflow (nix flake check with nextest)
# - Madsim deterministic simulation tests
# - Smoke tests with real processes
#
# To re-enable VM tests, the flake.nix needs to be updated to provide:
# - .#checks.x86_64-linux.cluster-test
# - .#nixosConfigurations."x86_64-linux-aspen-node-{1,2,3}"
#
# For now, this workflow only verifies that VM test code compiles.
